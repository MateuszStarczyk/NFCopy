/**
 * The Sink interface defines an API for different types of data sinks.
 * A data sink is a class which receives all NFC traffic and does something with it.
 * For example, a FileSink could log all raw bytes to file, a NetworkSink could send it to another
 * Server, ...
 *
 * Sinks are communication with a SinkManager using a java.io.PipedReader. They receive raw bytes
 * and it is up to them to decide what to do with them. They SHOULD NOT block for too long to avoid
 * blocking the SinkManager (writes to PipedWriters block if the buffer is full).
